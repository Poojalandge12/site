<p><mark=color:red;>Colonialism has contributed to the authoritarian and undemocratic nature of African politics. Thomson argues that the African government’s character of exploiting peasants and the proletariat was derived from a recourse of classism introduced in the continent by colonialists. The colonial regime was characterized by authoritarian governments and exploitation, which was later adopted by self-centered, post-colonial elites. Ethnicity in Africa has contributed to political development, civil unrest, and conflicts and influenced Africa’s voting patterns. It has positively contributed to the political development of both the state and civil society.</p></mark>

Although ethnicity was traditionally perceived as a hindrance to economic and political development, various studies have shown that this argument is false. Ethnicity proponents claim that it is a legitimate tool that allows different ethnic groups to aggregate demands and mobilizes political support.</p>

<p>Political leaders recognize the ethno-regional power derived from the social heterogeneity of the African community. Each ethnic group has a cultural broker in the state who advocates for their interests and wants. Failing to satisfy a given ethnic group’s needs can lead to a challenge of the leader’s regime. To this end, the state strives to acquire legitimacy from each ethnic group to avoid political challenges to its rule. This approach allows each ethnic group to bargain and demand for their rights, whereas the state is forced to respond to civil society’s needs to acquire legitimacy and political support.</P>

<p>This hegemonic exchange leads to political and economic development because the state can only acquire ethnic endorsement if it distributes resources uniformly to each ethnic group. Compliance with the government’s authority is exchanged for an ethnic community’s representation. Hegemonic exchange refers to a mutual accommodation of parties’ interests based on accepted procedural norms and rules. With a degree of legitimacy and conformity, these political channels are being traded for a degree of representation.

It is not always possible to extend sovereignty to all ethnic groups. Additionally, other ethnic groups are so powerfully mobilized that leaders cannot impose their will on them. The failure to balance resource distribution among the ethnic groups can lead to civil unrest, ethnic rivalries, and leadership inefficiencies that emanate from hegemonic exchange. When one civil society feels it has limited representation in the state, it creates rivalry and civil unrest. For example, the genocide in Rwanda was caused by tensions between the two major ethnic communities. The Tutsi tribe dominated over other ethnic communities, leading to land competition, falling coffee prices, and economic malaise.</p>
